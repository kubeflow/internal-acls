# internal-acls

Repository used to maintain group ACLs used by the Kubeflow community.

For Google Groups in kubeflow.org, refer to `google_groups` subfolder.

Currently after modifying org.yaml, pytest should be manually run in
github-orgs directory to verify the change. This test will be run
automatically in a future change.
