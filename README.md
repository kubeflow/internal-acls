# internal-acls

Repository used to maintain group ACLs used by the Kubeflow community.

The text files contain lists of folks that should be added
to various Google Groups in kubeflow.org that control
access to various shared resources.

The script `sync_groups.sh` can be used to sync groups
using the GAM CLI. Only administrators with appropriate
permissions will be able to sync groups.

To create a new group

```
GROUP_NAME=google-kubecon-europe
GROUP_EMAIL=${GROUP_NAME}@kubeflow.org 
DESCRIPTION="Some group description"

/home/jlewi/bin/gam/gam create group ${GROUP_EMAIL} who_can_join invited_can_join \
  name ${GROUP_NAME} description "${DESCRIPTION}" \
  allow_external_members true
```

Currently after modifying org.yaml, pytest should be manually run in
github-orgs directory to verify the change. This test will be run
automatically in a future change.
